# Amplify
We searched around for the most serious issues that we confront on a daily basis in our community. We drive on damaged roads, stroll over open potholes, return home through unlit streets at night, and occasionally come across Street Fights in your area, which occurs regularly in places where the general public does not pay attention to.

The majority of these issues are frequently left unaddressed for months, if not years.

Amplify is a community platform (website) that allows individuals to flag their concerns. The raised Flags may then be shared with the community to seek support. To demonstrate their support for the problem, the community may view and upvote the Flags raised in their proximity. On the mainstream, all Flags are prioritized based on upvotes; more upvotes equals more pressing and urgent issues. The authorities may then review the prioritized list of the most critical concerns and take appropriate action, making the entire process more effective and efficient.

The following were the key causes behind this:
People don't submit these issues to the appropriate authorities since it's a time-consuming and inconvenient process to report them in person and then follow up on them on a regular basis to check on their progress. This also leads to a lack of community collaboration since no one wants to deal with the process personally and prefers to delegate it to others.

Authorities' poor mapping, documenting, and monitoring of concerns around the city leads some small issues to be resolved quickly while more serious issues take months to resolve.
To address this issue, we devised a system to systematize the issue-raising process, making it accessible to everybody, simple and quick to use for the public, and effective and efficient for the authorities to respond to.
