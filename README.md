We searched around for the most serious issues that we confront on a daily basis in our community. We drive on damaged roads, stroll over open potholes, return home through unlit streets at night, and occasionally come across Street Fights in your area, which occurs regularly in places where the general public does not pay attention to.

The majority of these issues are frequently left unaddressed for months, if not years.
